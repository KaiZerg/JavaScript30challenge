WHAT DID I LEARN?


1):root is highest level to declaire var in css;

2)--base: #ffc600 - defining variable, -- equal to $ in sass;

3) padding: var(--spacing) - assining var to the element property;

4) querySelectorAll to select all inputs. It returns Node list(look likes an array);

5) Node list Vs Array - is that array has all kinds of different methods to deal with arrays.
Node list has only a few methods;

6)data- attribues used to define data-sizing=px of the inputs in html;

7)dataset - is an object that will contain all data attributes: console.log returns - DOMStringMap{sizing:"px"} ,
assing px to the const;

8)select entire document and setting property of our variables using name="spacing" ect
  using ${} because we are using variables, values can vary
  setting ${} to this.value
  adding suffix to the end, to append px to the range value
